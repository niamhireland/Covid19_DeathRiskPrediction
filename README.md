# COVID-19 Death Risk Prediction

## 📘 About The Project

This project was completed when I studied Data Analytics during my MSc. The objective was to build a data model to understand and predict death risk associated with COVID-19, using real-world case surveillance data collected by the CDC.

The task was divided into two main stages, with one notebook corresponding to each:

## 🔍 Data Understanding & Preparation
I was provided with anonymised patient records containing demographic, clinical, and outcome information. From this, I:
+ 📊 Produced a **data quality report**
+ 🧹 Outlined a **systematic data cleaning** and transformation plan
+ 🧠 Performed **exploratory feature analysis**
+ 🧩 Created **domain-informed features** for predictive modelling

## 🤖 Model Training & Evaluation
Using the cleaned dataset, I trained multiple models to identify high-risk cases:

+ 🧪  Trained **Logistic Regression**, **Linear Regression**, and **Random Forest** models
+ 📏 Evaluated each using **precision**, **accuracy**, and **F1 score**
+ 🔍 Identified strengths and weaknesses of each model's performance.
+ 💡 Recommended future improvements and additional features

## 🗃️ Dataset

Data sourced from the [CDC COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4). 

Each student worked with a unique, anonymised subset. The specific subsection of data I worked with was selected by my lecturer and is available in this repo, at data/raw . 

My dataset contains 50,000 records and includes both survivors and non-survivors.

## 🛠️ Built With 

- 🐍 `Python`
- 📊 `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation
- 📉 `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
- 🧠 `scikit-learn` – Feature engineering and modeling
- 📓 `Jupyter notebook` – development and presentation

## 🙏 Thanks To

My lecturer Georgiana Ifrim, who taught the Data Analytics module of the MSc Computer Science in UCD. Her guidance and support was invaluable.
