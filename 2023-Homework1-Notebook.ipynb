    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework focuses on data understanding and preparation for a particular problem and dataset.\n",
    "The data comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/). CDC is a USA health protection agency and is in charge of collecting data about the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular, tracking cases and trends of COVID-19 in the United States. CDC collects and makes public deidentified individual-case data on a daily basis, submitted using standardized case reporting forms. In this analysis, we focus on using the data collected by CDC to build a data analytics solution for death risk prediction. CDC collects demographic characteristics, exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, clinical data, laboratory diagnostic test results, and comorbidities. It also includes information on whether the individual survived or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we work with is a sample of the public data released by CDC, where the outcome for the target feature death_yn is known (i.e., either 'yes' or 'no'):\n",
    "https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4\n",
    "\n",
    "Each student will work with a different subset of the data. The CSV file is named using the format: **covid19-cdc-[your-student-number].csv**, e.g., **covid19-cdc-12345678.csv** is the data file for a student with number 12345678. You need to work with the CSV file corresponding to your student number, available from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BvAsc_dT8sOpqoiIDWtYDovCUYEgxug0?usp=sharing. There are 4 parts for this homework. Each part has an indicative maximum percentage given in brackets, e.g., part (1) has a maximum of 40% shown as [40]. The total marks are then converted to a grade, e.g., 40% maps to a pass grade D-, 75% maps to a B.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(1). [40] Prepare a data quality report for your CSV file. Below you have a set of guideline steps to help you in this process. All the steps need to be implemented with Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Check how many rows and columns your dataset has.\n",
    "    - Print the first and the last 5 rows.\n",
    "    - Convert the features to their appropriate data types (e.g., decide which features are more appropriate as \n",
    "    continuous and which ones as categorical types). \n",
    "    - Look for duplicate rows and columns. Consider whether it makes sense to keep them or drop them.\n",
    "    - Look for constant columns. Consider whether it makes sense to keep them or drop them.\n",
    "    - Save your updated/cleaned data frame to a new csv file.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    For the updated CSV and data frame (after column/row removal):\n",
    "    - Prepare a table with descriptive statistics for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Prepare a table with descriptive statistics for all the categorical features.\n",
    "    - Plot histograms for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Plot box plots for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Plot bar plots for all the categorical features.\n",
    "    - Discuss your initial findings from the tables and plots.\n",
    "    - Prepare the initial discussion of your findings into a single data quality report PDF file. \n",
    "    The PDF report should focus on the key issues identified in the data and discuss potential strategies to handle them. Simple listing of tables and plots without discussion of findings will not receive full marks. To receive full marks you need to show your understanding and analysis of the dataset, through a detailed discussion for each feature. The report should be concise and complete, the goal is not to make it long for the sake of length, but to cover all the important aspects of the features. The notebook provides detailed steps with code, while the report is a summary of findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2). [30] Prepare a data quality plan for the cleaned CSV file. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Mark down all the features where there are potential problems or data quality issues.\n",
    "    - Propose solutions to deal with the problems identified. Explain why did you choose one solution over \n",
    "    potentially many other. It is very important to provide justification for your thinking in this part and to list potential solutions, including the solution that will be implemented to clean the data.\n",
    "    - Apply your solutions to obtain a new CSV file where the identified data quality issues were addressed. \n",
    "    - Save the new CSV file with a self explanatory name. \n",
    "    - Save the data quality plan to a single PDF file.\n",
    "        \n",
    "(3). [15] Exploring relationships between feature pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Choose a subset of features you find promising and plot pairwise feature interactions (e.g., \n",
    "    continuous-continuous feature plot or continuous-categorical plots or correlation plots). \n",
    "    Explain your choices.\n",
    "    - Discuss your findings from the plots above. Do you find any features or feature combinations that are \n",
    "    indicative of the target outcome? Explain in plain words (a short paragraph) the story of your\n",
    "    findings so far.\n",
    "    \n",
    "(4). [15] Create new features: Transform, extend or combine the existing features, or add new features from external sources, to create a few new features (at least 3) with the aim to better capture the problem domain and the target outcome. Justify the steps and choices you are making. In the grading, consideration will be given to the creativity and domain knowledge shown in preparing the new features. Use code to show that your new features are indeed useful for the target prediction problem. Add these features to your clean dataset and save it as a CSV file with a self explanatory name. "
